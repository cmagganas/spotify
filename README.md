This application allows you to create a playlist via Spotify’s Web API with a few tuning parameters. Sign in to allow app to personalize the playlist to your taste.

	Clicking Generate Quick Playlist (without having to sign in to Spotify) allows anyone to create a playlist with some music they might want to hear based on the options they select.
  	To access the other two buttons, simply sign in to Spotify with the sign in button. By signing in, you are then able to create a playlist with recommended songs that are based on your personal music taste (ie. your top songs).
  	Clicking Generate Unique Playlist will create a playlist with recommendations based on your music taste.
   Clicking Generate Collaborative Playlist w/ me will create a playlist with recommendations based on both your music taste as well my own.
   Try different options to see what recommendations you like!
