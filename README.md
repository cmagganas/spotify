This application allows you to create a playlist via Spotify’s Web API with a few tuning parameters. Sign in to allow app to personalize the playlist to your taste.

* Clicking Generate Quick Playlist (without having to sign in to Spotify) allows anyone to create a playlist with some music they might want to hear based on the options they select.
* To access the other two buttons, simply sign in to Spotify with the sign in button. By signing in, you are then able to create a playlist with recommended songs that are based on your personal music taste (ie. your top songs).
* Clicking Generate Unique Playlist will create a playlist with recommendations based on your music taste.
* Clicking Generate Collaborative Playlist w/ me will create a playlist with recommendations based on both your music taste as well my own.
* Try different options to see what recommendations you like!
